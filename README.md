# Web Scapper for jobs offers


## Why did I create this program?

I created this program to **find a job as a developer more efficiently**.
Instead of spending hours manually browsing through job listings, many of which donâ€™t match my developer profile, this tool automates the process. It filters out irrelevant offers and focuses only on opportunities that align with my skills and interests as a developer..


## Usage
To use this program introduce the **URL** of the careers site. This URl will pass to de function.
```python
def extract_offers(url, file_name)
